PROBLEM: Chaining operations fix (doesn't perform them in correct order)
	- previous and current operators possible solution
SOLVED: if statement before event listener switchcase (line 35)


PROBLEM: Unexpected result occurs after user enters a number then an operator then the equals sign
SOLVED: ?Problem not recreatable

PROBLEM: Incorrect calculations after equals btn pressed
SOLVED: added if (operatorCounter >= 1)

PROBLEM: Calculations after equals sign not following BEDMAS/Order of operations
	- e.x. 5-2=3-2*4 --> should =-5, calc shows =4
	- Difficult because prev and current strategy doesn't account for an operation that has precedence over the previous one, it will always get the answer before the equals sign is pressed.
	- A lot of the Odin calculators I looked at have this problem.
